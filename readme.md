INTRODUCTION
------------

This is a very simple module that opens up images or content from your Backdrop site into a popup/modal "lightbox" and is very customizable.

Colorbox is a light-weight, customizable lightbox plugin for jQuery 1.4.3+.
This module allows for integration of Colorbox into Backdrop.
The jQuery library is a part of Drupal since version 5+.

Images, iframed or inline content etc. can be displayed in a
overlay above the current page.
